# Jirafy Sync
Sync Jira tickets and version based on a given changelog (ideally generated by [Jirafy Changelog](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jirafy-changelog))

## What does Jirafy Sync do?
This action requires a changelog as input. If the changelog has references to Jira tickets, it will parse the changelog for Jira projects and tickets. For each project, the latest repository release will be the Jira project version created. Each Jira ticket's `fixVersions` property will be updated to the corresponding Jira version created.

## Inputs
Jira credentials are required in order for Jirafy Sync to authenticate to the Jira rest api on your behalf.
- jiraUsername
  - Username of a jira user (preferably one designated for automation tasks)
- jiraToken
  - Corresponding [token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) of the jira user
- jiraHost
  - Jira organization host name (i.e jirafy-sync.atlassian.net)
- changelog
  - A generated changelog
    - **TIP:** Use [Jirafy Changelog](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jirafy-changelog)
- jiraVersion
  - Github release version # (i.e v2.1.0)
    - **TIP:** Use the Jirafy Changelog output: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.changelog }}

## Recommended github workflow
- Jirafy Sync works best if [Jirafy Changelog](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jirafy-changelog) github action generates the changelog. The changelog can be generated given there is already at least one github release in your repository.

- Next you'll need to generate a release. I recommend using [actions/create-release@latest](https://github.com/actions/create-release).

- Finally you'll want to sync the github release with a jira version using [Jirafy Sync](https://github.com/onXmaps/jirafy-sync#jirafy-sync) action. The `${{ github.ref_name }}` value is the tag that triggers the recommended workflow and should set as the input of `jiraVersion` property. The action will create the corresponding Jira project versions that don't already exist, as well as update the fix version of each ticket that was found in the given changelog.
